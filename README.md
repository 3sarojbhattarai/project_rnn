# RNN-Projects

These are the projects build with Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) using Tensorflow 2.
# Overview
 Currently there are five projects  which covers different types of RNN Projects.The project includes 
 1. Stock Market Prediction
 2. Multi-Step Time Series Forecasting
 3. Automated Essay Grading
 4. Machine Language Translation(Seq to Seq model, and Attention Mechanism). 

# Contributions
You can contribute in web app and RNN model and send me a pull requests.

Cheers !!!


# Local Development
* Clone this repository to your local machine
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/3sarojbhattarai/project_rnn/
  ```

* In the directory where you placed the cloned repo, create a virtual environment for Python:
  ```shell
  pip install virtualenv 
  virtualenv -p python3 venv
  ```
* Activate your virtual environment
  ```shell
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

* Install all required packages:
  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
